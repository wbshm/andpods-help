## Why the power display is a multiple of 5%
> [How to display accurate power - accurate to 1%](/en/2020/10/16/waiting-power/#III-Precise-power-display-accurate-to-1-in-line-with-IOS-app-version-1-6-5-or-above)
* Because AirPods pass over a multiple of 10% of the minimum scale. The display is 5% to keep the power error within 5%.

## Why prompt "This model does not support the h1 chip earphone power display"
* The current model does not support h1 chip power display, this has something to do with the Bluetooth hardware, you need to support Bluetooth 5.0 and above, there is no solution.

* AirPods Pro earphone can switch noise cancellation by long pressing the earphone stalk. The default long press on the earphone is noise cancellation/through switch, you can connect IOS devices (Iphone,Ipad) to set the checkbox off mode, so you can switch between the three modes.

## Why AirPods volume is lighter
* If you find that the volume of AirPods is light, it may be because the absolute volume function of the earphone is turned on.
* You can try to stop the absolute volume in the developer options.
* When the absolute volume feature is turned on, the volume of the earphone and the volume of the phone are separated.
* This way the volume of the earphone and the phone will be synchronized and you can use the phone's volume control to control the earphone volume.

## Why do you need locate permission
* The scanning of low power Bluetooth needs the support of location permission.

## New version upgrade Pro operation

* Set up the corresponding left and right touch function on your Apple device. (You only need to set it once)
* Connect the earphone to the phone with AndPods again, open the software settings, and set the touch function to default.

## Power display, in-ear detection with delay
* In the power display of H1 chip earphone (AirPods Pro, AirPods II, Powerbeats Pro), there is a delay in the protocol acquisition, so there is no way to display the power and in-ear detection in time. (The delay is about 3 seconds)
